# Building Blocks

***

## **Project Description**&#x20;

We are currently working on a framework (and which includes a collection of libraries) here at Collabo Community, called _**Building Blocks**_. Building blocks is broad, but here's the summary: It is a "mindset" that encourages approaching anything (UI/UX design, code writing, documentation, product development etc.) in a performant, structured and predictable manner - different from what developers/engineers are used to when dealing/working with existing frameworks or libraries, but not entirely different too.

Project details for Building Blocks is only available within the community (i.e. within our Discord community server channels) for now up to the version we are working towards releasing next, and will be available to the public after the said version of the framework is released.
