# Collabocate

***

## **Project Description**

_**Collabocate**_ (Collabo~~rate~~ + ~~Communi~~cate) has a lot of moving parts like other projects that are being built within the Collabo Community. Find the project description for one of the projects under the collabocate project below.

_**GitHub Sync:**_ Collabocate GitHub Sync works with the GitHub REST API under the hood to remove the technical hurdles associated with directly interacting with project repositories that reside on the GitHub platform, for non-technical users or contributors to such open source projects (and technical users or contributors alike). \
A two-way communication enabler for open source project users and/or contributors to interact and collaborate on any open source GitHub project with no borders or barriers.\
Users and contributors of the open source project that uses it can:

* "Kill two (2) birds with one (1) stone (and at the same time)" i.e. They can harness both the "super powers" of the project's app and that of GitHub at the same time optimally, as though they are dealing with just one app.
* Seamlessly interact with one or more of open source GitHub repositories connected to such project from the comfort of the user interface of the project, no new/long learning curve required.
* Other information coming soon after version 1 of GitHub Sync is released.

Project details for GitHub Sync is only available within the community (i.e. within our Discord community server channels) for now up to the version we are working towards releasing next, and will be available to the public after the said version of the project is released. Project details for the other projects under Collabocate are only available within the community, and will be available to the public as soon as the community starts developing them.
