# Overview: Collabo Community Projects

***

_Projects built within the Collabo Community are not (entirely) new. Like most other open source communities or individual projects, we are involved in building web and mobile applications, libraries (and frameworks) etc. The only difference is that based on our collective experiences, our own community introduces them in a new light and from a very different perspective than what a lot of techies are used to._

Based on the nature of our projects (i.e. based the fact that they each have a lot of moving parts, that they each may have complex web-like connection with other independent projects built within the community, and the new light in which these projects are introduced), our team tends toward adopting a more rigid approach to working on and helping contributors get better understanding of our community projects.

In other to begin to understand the projects built within the Collabo Community, we recommend to first understand the Collabo Community, the problems the community seeks to solve through the projects built within it. Our [community resource documentation](https://resources.collabocommunity.com/) is a great place to start to get to know us, and understand the goals we plan towards achieving through our community and projects. Interacting our community on Discord should also help to make things clearer.

We usually structure documentation content in a way that doesn't force our documentation users to go through content irrelevant to them. In this case, we have added all project descriptions here in one place to help us have a shared understanding of the projects. <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Find the</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark>_<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**description**</mark>_ <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="background-color:yellow;">for each of our</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark>_<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**community projects**</mark>_ <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="background-color:yellow;">and how you can</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark>_<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**contribute**</mark>_ <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="background-color:yellow;">to any of them, through the</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark>_<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**sidebar**</mark>_ <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="background-color:yellow;">of this documentation page.</mark> You are welcome to contribute to any area that interests from our list, or you can let us know through our community channels, what other thing(s) you have in mind to help out with if not on our list yet.
