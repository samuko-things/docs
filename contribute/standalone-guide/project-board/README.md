# Project Board: Finding issue tickets to work on in Collabo Community

***

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you don't find or are not able to access any issue tickets to work on from the board, or if it is looking like the project board is inactive, please contact us on our Discord Community Server. Work is actively going on in our community whether you are able to see it publicly or not. Sometimes you may not see activity in some or all of our public platforms or channels - this is because there are parts of the projects we do not wish to discuss in our public platforms (just yet) even if the projects have public GitHub repositories.

## Use the project board to find issue tickets to work on

**Project board link:** [https://github.com/orgs/collabo-community/projects/1?pane=info](https://github.com/orgs/collabo-community/projects/1?pane=info)

The link to the Collabo Community project board above already has filters applied, to help you better find issue tickets by the area of project development, project or topic that you are interested in.&#x20;

There is a list of labels on the left hand side of the board. Clicking on the labels on the left side of the board will change the board content accordingly: to only show the issue tickets for that area of project development, project or topic that you have selected.

Here's a youtube video that should help to understand how to interact with the Collabo Community board:

## **Getting assigned to issue ticket, and why get assigned**

_**Volunteer contributors:**_ Comment on an issue ticket that interests you to get assigned to it. Get assigned to the issue ticket before you start working on the issue ticket assignment. You can request to be assigned to an issue ticket from the Todo column of the project board.

_**Repo maintainers, community mentors and Interns:**_ Assign yourself to an issue ticket before you start working on the issue ticket assignment. You can assign yourself to an issue ticket from the Todo column of the project board.

Once you are assigned to an issue ticket, members of the community will be able to see the activities on that ticket as you work on it. This promotes transparency, reduces confusion and is useful to providing you support in case you get stuck. You can only work on or request to work on one issue ticket at a time (i.e. get an approving review on pull request submitted, before requesting to work on another issue ticket). Be patient with reviewers.
