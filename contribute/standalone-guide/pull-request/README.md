# Guidelines for submitting pull requests to any repository

***

* Submitting a pull request for an issue you are not assigned to will only be counted as spam.
* Try to submit a pull request for an issue within 2 days of showing interest, even if you are not through fixing the issue.
* A pull request should be linked to the issue it aims to fix. [_**Watch tutorial.**_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqJWDTZdQG4\&list=PLMDhbo3xlD1ESa1\_9WN4yG7bGDDksEQx7\&index=4\&t=301s)
* Pull request title must reflect the Issue title you are working on, and it should start with "Fix: ". For example, If the issue title is "Add contribution rules section", the pull request title should be "Fix: Add contribution rules section". [_**Watch tutorial.**_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej396Vra1oQ\&list=PLMDhbo3xlD1ESa1\_9WN4yG7bGDDksEQx7\&index=14)
* Feel free to ask questions in the community channels, if you are not clear about something in the issue you are working on.
* Once you are done and your pull request is ready for review, create another comment there in the pull request you have submitted, and tag _**@code-collabo/community-mentors**_ to help review it. Or you can request for review through the GitHub UI there in you pull request, by selecting _**@code-collabo/community-mentors**_ from the reviewers dropdown. \
  \
  **Note:** If you don't tag or request for review in the manner described above, mentors may not receive notifications on GitHub about it, and they may not know that your pull request exists.
