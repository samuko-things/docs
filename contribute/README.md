# ðŸ‘· Contributing Guide Test

***

_This contribution guide will help you find all the resources you will need to start contributing to the Collabo community and projects._

***

Here... at _<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**@collabo-community**</mark>_, quality comes before quantity. We prefer you submit one thing (in time) and with good quality, than submitting 10 things (in time) that doesn't have quality. And we are not expecting you to achieve this all by your self. We are aware that you may not be used to the tools that we use or that this may be your first time in a setting like this. Therefore we provide you with as much assistance that we discover that you need at the beginning of your journey with _<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**@collabo-community**</mark>_ and along the way. We follow our contributing guide strictly. Ensure to not skip any of the sections below so that you can understand how we encourage you to go about contributing to _<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**@collabo-community,**</mark>_ and so that your contributions don't stay in review for too long.

## Code of Conduct

Before you start contributing, read up our Community Code of Conduct and rules to help understand how we'd like community members to comport themselves, relate with and be mindful of other members of the community.

## Navigating collabo contributor docs

To help you easily find the specific contributor docs for your area of interest and/or expertise, we have separated the content accordingly. At the top left of any page of the collabo contributor docs,  you will find a dropdown element where you can get to select the contributor docs for the area that interests you to contribute to. If you are on a mobile phone, then this dropdown is somewhere in the sidebar. At the moment we only have contributor docs and projects in the following areas: Software Engineering, UI/UX Design, Technical Writing and Documentation.

## Finding issue tickets and assignments to work on

Check the [Collabo Community Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/code-collabo/projects/2/views/1). You can choose from any column on this board depending on your interest and/or area of expertise.&#x20;

_**Volunteer contributors:**_ Comment on an issue ticket that interests you to get assigned to it. Get assigned to the issue ticket before you start working on the issue ticket assignment.

_**Repo maintainers, community mentors and Interns:**_ Assign yourself to an issue ticket before you start working on the issue ticket assignment.

Once you are assigned to an issue ticket, members of the community will be able to see the activities on that ticket as you work on it. This promotes transparency, reduces confusion and is useful to providing you support in case you get stuck. You can only work on or request to work on one issue ticket at a time (i.e. get an approving review on pull request submitted, before requesting to work on another issue ticket). Be patient with reviewers.

## Reporting issues you find with collabo projects

We encourage you to report any (not yet reported) issues that you detect with any of our repositories or applications that you are working on. [Report issues for any of our repositories here](https://github.com/code-collabo/.github/issues/new). Repository maintainers and/or community mentors will sort them out and send them to the appropriate columns on the Collabo Community Task Board for you and other contributors to be able to start working on them.
