## Local development instructions

Find the local development instructions for the different Create Collabo App projects in the tabs below, depending on the one you want to develop locally.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}
_**Local development instructions:**_

* Head over to the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/collabo-community/create-collabo-app](https://github.com/collabo-community/create-collabo-app)
* Fork and clone the repository as shown in the [SWE contribution workflow](https://docs.collabocommunity.com/contribute/v/software-engineering/#git-workflow-fork-and-clone-repository).

_**Instructions for installing dependencies and linking CLI:**_

{% hint style="info" %}
Once you have the repository on your local computer, ensure you are _**in the root of the project's directory**_. Then install globally and uninstall globally following the steps below.
{% endhint %}

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Link after installing dependencies, so that you can access/use the Create Collabo App commands in the terminal:

```
npm link
```

Unlink (this is for when you are done developing):

```
npm unlink
```

***

_**CLI commands and flags:**_

The way you operate/run the CLI is still largely the same as what is in the former [Node Mongo user doc](https://docs.collabocommunity.com/node-mongo/detailed-guide) at the moment. The only difference (for now) is the main CLI command i.e. Instead of `node-mongo`, use `collabo-be`. Similarly for the shorter version of the commands - instead of `nmgo`, use `c-be`.

{% tab title="Backend API Boilerplates" %}
_**Local development instructions:**_

* Head over to the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/collabo-community/backend-api-boilerplates](https://github.com/collabo-community/backend-api-boilerplates)
* Fork and clone the repository as shown in the [SWE contribution workflow](https://docs.collabocommunity.com/contribute/v/software-engineering/#git-workflow-fork-and-clone-repository).

_**Instructions for installing dependencies and starting the development server:**_

{% hint style="info" %}
Once you have the repository on your local computer, follow the steps below.
{% endhint %}

* Change directory into any of these folders in the repository, depending on the template you wish to work on: `ts-esm-async-await` folder, `js-esm-async-await` folder, `js-cjs-async-await` folder or `js-cjs-then` folder.
* Once in the chosen folder, follow _**steps 1 to 4**_ in the tabs under the [Running the generated backend API application](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/node-mongo-user/node-mongo-user-docs/readme#running-the-generated-backend-api-application) section of the former Node mongo user docs, depending on the connection setup type you prefer to use. \
  _**Some slight modifications to the steps exist:**_ We have removed the automated dev server for now. For _**step 4**_, just use `npm run dev:atlas` or `npm run dev:local` script commands accordingly.

***

_**Handling .env files during development:**_

* Retain the `.env.example` file so that it doesn't get deleted from our repo when you submit your code fix.
* Create a copy of the `.env.example` file, rename this copy to `.env` , then change the `PORT` and add other environment variables to store your secrets as desired or as needed in your `.env` file.
