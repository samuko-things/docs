# Collabo Community Blog

***

{% hint style="info" %}
DO NOT copy and paste someone else's blog post from somewhere on the internet to present as your own work. Submit blog post written in your own words. If you do use someone else's words, design etc, please reference them in the blog post and include links to such works where necessary.



Only add content that you know or are sure you can put out for free, in the blog post that you submit to this repo.



You are also welcome to submit blog posts you have previously written on other platforms. Just that they must adhere to all that is written above too.
{% endhint %}

## What to write about

The blog post(s) you submit do not have to be related to or specific to the _**@collabo-community**_. You can write about a topic specific to open source, or even write about something that is not necessarily open source but can be useful to maintainers, users and contributors to open source projects. You can also write about tech things in general.

## Where to find and make changes to blog posts

We host our blog posts on [Hashnode](https://collabocommunity.hashnode.dev/). Changes however are made through [the blog's Github Repo](https://github.com/code-collabo/community-blog).&#x20;

## Suggesting and writing a new blog post

You would usually [find (new blog post or blog post improvement issue tickets) to work on on the project board](https://docs.collabocommunity.com/contribute/#finding-issue-tickets-and-assignments-to-work-on). But incase you would like to suggest and work on a new blog post you can let _**@community-mentors**_ know in the appropriate channel in our Discord community server.

## How to format new blog post

Create a markdown file i.e. file with .md extension. The (full) title of the blog post you are submitting should be the name of the .md file you create (make sure to use hyphens in the file name instead of spaces).

Use the format in the code block below to add your blog content to the .md file. Here's an example of how your blog post submission should look like in a .md file after using the format in the box above - [.md file example](https://github.com/code-collabo/submit-a-blog-post/blob/main/what-is-code-collabo-and-who-is-it-for.md).

Send a pull request for review. Don't forget to drop links to your Twitter and LinkedIn handles in your pull request so that you can be tagged as the blog post author, when we announce the release of the blog post on our Twitter and LinkedIn handles.

```
**Title: Your blog post title goes here**

Subtitle: Blog post subtitle goes here (subtitle is optional)

*Blog post by [Your full name here](link to your github profile here).*

The body/content of your blog post goes here
```
