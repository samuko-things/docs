## Making and submitting changes for documentation projects

See tabs below for the different methods/mediums you can use to edit technical or non-technical writing and documentation projects.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Option 1: GitBook" %}
_**Request access to GitBook**_

Our documentation projects reside on GitBook. Request access to GitBook from the _**@community-coordinator**_, so that you can be given editor access.

***

_**Edit and submit change requests**_

* Locate the documentation project you want to contribute to on GitBook
* Click on the _**edit button**_ on the top right corner of the document
* Make desired changes to the pages as needed
* Once satisfied/done, click on _**request review**_ button. Reviewer(s) will check out your changes, approve or request you to fix things in your submission as required.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Option 2: GitHub" %}
_**GitHub repository for documentation projects**_

Our GitBook docs are synced to one GitHub repository, so that you can find them and edit them on GitHub too.

GitHub repository link: [https://github.com/collabo-community/docs](https://github.com/collabo-community/docs)
