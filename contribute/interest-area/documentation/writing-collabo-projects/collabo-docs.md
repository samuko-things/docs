# Collabo Docs

***

## Contributions classified under documentation

At **@collabo-community**, documentation involves writing any of the following:&#x20;

* Instructions to help new and old community members (contributors or users) navigate through, and get the best out of the community.&#x20;
* User instructions for where to find and how to use published code collabo projects/products.
* Instructions to help contributors with information on how to contribute, where to find projects to contribute to within the community, the workflows, and set up guides for the projects they choose/wish to contribute to.
* _**Technical content writing:**_ This involves writing technical or code related content. In this case, you may need to work with Software Engineering contributors and learn how to run the projects to be able to understand how to contribute. You may want to visit the [Software Engineering documentation](https://docs.collabocommunity.com/contribute/v/software-engineering/) to get acquainted with the technical aspects of some collabo projects.
* _**Non-Technical content writing:**_ These involves writing creatively, adding image and/or video (non-code) content.
