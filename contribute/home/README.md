_This contribution guide will help you find all the resources you will need to start contributing to the Collabo Community and projects._

***

Here at Collabo Community, quality comes before quantity. We prefer you submit one thing (in time) and with good quality, than submitting 10 things (in time) that doesn't have quality. We are not expecting you to achieve this all by yourself. We are aware that you may not be used to the tools that we use or that this may be your first time in a setting like this. Therefore we provide you with as much assistance that we discover that you need, at the beginning of your journey with Collabo Community and along the way. We follow our contributing guide strictly. Ensure to not skip any of the sections below so that you can understand how we encourage you to go about contributing to Collabo Community, and so that your contributions don't stay in review for too long.

## Reporting issues you find with collabo projects

We encourage you to report any (not yet reported) issues that you detect with any of our repositories or applications that you are working on. [Report issues for any of our repositories to _**Product Issue Reports**_](https://github.com/collabo-community/product-issue-reports/issues/new/choose). Repository maintainers and/or community mentors will sort them out and send them to the appropriate columns on the Collabo Community Task Board for you and other contributors to be able to start working on them.
