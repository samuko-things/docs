# ðŸ“” Code of Conduct

***

{% hint style="success" %}
Here at _**@collabo-community**_, there is nothing like foolish or stupid question. We encourage you to ask any questions on your mind about _**@collabo-community**_, projects and what you are working on.
{% endhint %}

***

We love to make the community fun to be in and talk about, but with the mind that we mean business as we go about making contributions to the community. The rules are not to scare anyone off, but to help us stick to and achieve our goals. Nobody is above these rules. Please take note of the following:

* You cannot mock anyone for or discourage anyone from asking questions about Collabo projects or assignments, even if you think it's too simple. Instead we prefer you help them understand how to go about Collabo projects and assignments.
* You cannot mock anyone for the kind of projects they choose to or choose not to participate in within the _**@collabo-community**_.
* We do not use or permit the use of "f" word or any slang or language generally known as offensive.
* Use _**@collabo-community**_ channels for _**@collabo-community**_ related conversations only (we also encourage you to protect your privacy in DMs).
* No insults allowed. Be respectful to other members of the community in your asks, responses and conversations in general.
* No bullying of any sort. We want a habitable and hospitable community for everyone regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, belief etc.
* Avoid jokes, talk or behaviours that steer up gender wars, ethnic rivalry etc.
* Do not send any kind of sensual, sexual or pornographic material, or content that promote nudity or lewd behaviours.
* Report any misconduct or breaking of rules to the _**@community-coordinator.**_
* Aiding and abetting someone to break any of the community rules is the same as breaking that rule yourself.
* Breaking the rules may (at some point and depending on which one you broke) lead to eviction from the community.
